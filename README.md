# Welcome to the Batalha TGPSI Portal
This project was developed to be a portal for programmers from Batalha's Technical Professional Course in Computer Systems Management and Programming (TGPSI) to the world. The portal contains information about our course, as well as about us, the site's developers. In addition, there is an exhibition of student projects, Erasmus experiences, PAPs and much more. The site also contains news about our course and the developers' contact information and social networks.

In short, the site is a portal that can attract young people about to enter high school and interested in joining our course, as well as companies that can view student profiles, see what they do, what projects they have already done and consider hiring them for internships.
